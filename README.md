# Typescript Angular Infrastructure
## Summary
Frontend Infrastructure with Angular , Typescript and modern frontend  
## Detailed
Web development with Javascript, Html and css and without serverside template engines add ability to programs to run in any platform.of course this approach have difficulties along with itself such as:
* Lack of structure and pattern for placement of .js, .css and .html files and using them.
* Weakness of javascript language in order to use in large scale applications.
Solution of first problem is using of spa frameworks such as backbonejs, emberjs, knockoutjs and etc. solution of second problem is using of higher level language than javascript such as dart, coffeescript and etc.
I have tried to design an infrastructure with the angularjs and typescript in order to simplify development of User Interface layer.
